    <p class=" h4 text-left"><u>Weekly Game Nights</u></p>
    <p class="text-left">
        Every Wednesday and Sunday at 7:30pm we get together on the discord server to play 
        online games such as Overwatch, Jackbox or even Skribbl.io etc. These are run by the 
        commitee and give people an opportunity to try new games out meet new people.

            Old school gaming meetups. Come and test your mettle at Super Smash Bros., 
            show off your footsies in Street Fighter and go for gold Mario Kart 8. Or perhaps 
            try to beat the commitees Renai Circulation Beat Saber score. There are always a 
            variety of setups and genres at each LAN. Attendees are encouraged to bring thier 
            own kit but there will always be something for you to have a go on if you cant.

    <p class="h4 text-right"><u>Weekly Distanced Meetups</u></p>
    <p class="text-right">
        Every Friday we meet up to take a break from the stress of students life and have a 
        drink at the pub. Previously these meetups were head in pubs or Teviot Row but due 
        to the ongoing pandemic we decided to have distanced meetups outside, usually 
        the meadows. These will be carried out as per government advice.
