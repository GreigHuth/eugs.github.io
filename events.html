        <p><u>Monthly LAN parties</u></p>
        <p>
            We all get together and play an assortment of PC console games. 
            Everyone is encouraged to bring their own stuff but the commitee 
            does supply some consoles and even a VR setup!
        </p>

        <p><u>The Video Game Music Game (VGMG)</u></p>
        <p>
            A game which is run online on our discord server. The game
            is simple, a music track is played over voice chat in discord and 
            you have to answer what it is.
        </p>

        <p><u>Weekly Game Nights</u></p>
        <p>
            Every Wednesday we get people on the discord server together to play an 
            online PC game such as CS:GO, Overwatch. LOL etc. These are run by the commitee
            and give people an opportunity to try new games out and hangout with people.
        </p>

        <p><u>Weekly Pub Nights</u></p>
        <p>
            Every Friday we meet up to take a break from the stress of students life 
            and have a drink at the pub.
