    <p class="text-left">
        Every Wednesday we get people on the discord server together to play an 
        online PC game such as CS:GO, Overwatch. LOL etc. These are run by the commitee
        and give people an opportunity to try new games out and hangout with people.

            Old school gaming meetups. Come and test your mettle at Super Smash Bros., show off your footsies in Street Fighter and go for gold Mario Kart 8. Or perhaps try to beat one the commitees Renai Circulation

    <p class="h4 text-right"><u>Weekly Distanced Meetups</u></p>
    <p class="text-right">
        Every Friday we meet up to take a break from the stress of students life and have a drink at the pub. 
        Previously these meetups were head in pubs or Teviot Row but due to the ongoing pandemic we decided to have
        distanced meetups outside, usually the meadows.
